   "source": [
    "Amazon is the one of the world's biggest e-commerce platform. Apart from its own platform, Amazon has different channels of customer support. Twitter is one of them. Amazon has a customer suport account on Twitter called @Amazonhlep. It is not surprise that the volume of customer requests is huge. In 2017 , there are nearly 100K tweets on AmazonHelp. With such a high volume, maintaining the quality of the customer support would be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aim at having a better allocation of customer support workforce by identifying the intent of customer. The intention of customer will be categorized into different topics and then we can restructure the customer support team into sub team based on these topics.  Ultimately, to triage and route the customer support reqeusts to appropriate sub team in order to provide a more efficient customer support."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "No business can survive without customers. This reflects on the mission of Amazon, one of the world's biggest e-commerce platform, “to be Earth’s most customer-centric company\" and the award-winning Customer Service team is an essential part of this mission. This is why maintaining the quality of the customer support is crucial to Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### why Twitter?\n",
    "Firstly, Twitter can be a big showcase for Amazon customer support. It is a globally well known social media platform and it had more than 321 million monthly active users as of 2018. Unlike Amazon 's own customer support platform,  everyone can see other people's complaints or requests on AmazonHelp (Amazon's customer support on Twitter). Because Twitter's primary purpose is to connect people and allow people to share their thoughts with a big audience.If we can provide good quality and efficient customer support,it also facilitates to positive brand image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Twitter aims to create highly skimmable content for our tech-heavy, attention-deficit modern world. Thus, Tweets can be only up to 140 characters long. The short conversation is similar to live chat. Users contact customer support to have a specific problem solved, and the manifold of problems to be discussed is relatively small, especially compared to unconstrained conversational datasets like the reddit Corpus. Understanding the tweets pattern helps us to understand the talking pattern of the users nowaday. And this project explores Twitter as a pioneer project. We can start from Twitter first and then explore to other customer support platform such as Facebook, email.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Presence of non English tweets such as Japanese, Spanish, German as AmazonHelp support foreign languages.\n",
    "2. spam tweets, a single users contribute to 417 tweets alone. The tweets accross 2015-2017\n",
    "3. 99% of the tweets are requested in 2017 \n",
    "4. Oct,Nov and Dec has the most tweets. prioritize these three months.\n",
    "5. The SLA(Service Level Agreement) of AmazonHelp is around 13 mins.It can be the baseline of SLA. And when the tweet volumn are high in Oct, Nov and Dec. The SLA should be shorter than 13 mins. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset__\n",
    "The dataset `Customer Support on Twitter` is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/thoughtvector/customer-support-on-twitter). It offers a large corpus of modern English (mostly) conversations between consumers and customer support agents on Twitter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of the tweets refer to 108 different companies. AmazonHelp has the highest number of tweets. In this project, I will only focus on @AmazonHelp 's tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion and Recommendation \n",
    "LDA helped to categorize 3 main topics, they are inferred to be :\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 1 : Carrier - especially with USPS (Postal service company of United States)\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 2 : account issue - email follow up\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 3 : delivery - with Prime account\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation :\n",
    "To restructure the customer support team into sub team based on these 3 topics.\n",
    "For example, we can have a sub team dealing with carrier issue and espceially keep an eye on USPS. The second team will be responsible for incoming emails. The third team will be dealing with Prime account. And the peak season is in Oct, Nov and Dec, be aware of the allocation of staffs and the SLA.\n",
